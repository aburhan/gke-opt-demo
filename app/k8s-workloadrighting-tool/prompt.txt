Given the following JSON object representing Kubernetes workload resource cpu/memory - usage cpu and memory, current requests and limits, and cpu and memory recommendations:

{workload}

Analyze the data to recommend adjustments to CPU and memory requests and limits for the Kubernetes container named "server" in the "workload" Deployment to ensure reliability. Additionally, recommend a GCP instance type based on the controller type, image, and usage data provided.

Construct a message for a GitHub PR including:
- A statement on reliability risks for the "controller_name" Deployment's "container" container due to current resource settings.
- A 30-day usage analysis with max memory and CPU usage.
- Rightsizing recommendations for memory and CPU requests and limits, including a YAML snippet for updates.
- A recommendation for a GCP instance type suitable for the workload type, considering the nature of the "workload" Deployment.
- Notes on resource underutilization or overutilization with implications for increased reliability or cost savings.

Include error handling instructions and specify the file name and line numbers for the recommended updates in the PR message.
